                  <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 14pt;">Sena Sammatha Wickramabahu (1473–1511) was the first 
                    king of the Kingdom of Kandy. He was a royal from the Kotte Royal Bloodline and ruled Kandy as a semi-
                    independent kingdom under the Kingdom of Kotte, making it the new capital of the Kandyan Kingdom. 
                    Sena Sammatha Wickramabahu was followed by his son Jayaweera Astana (1511–1551) and then by Karaliyadde 
                    Bandara (1551–1581) who was succeeded by his daughter Dona Catherina of Kandy (1581–1581). Dona Catherina
                     was succeeded by Rajasinha I. Rajasinha I, however, preferred to rule the hill country from the Kingdom 
                     of Sitawaka on the west of the island. A period of turmoil for power ended with the ascent to the throne by 
                     Konappu Bandara who came to be known as Vimaladharmasuriya I. Having embraced Buddhism, he consolidated his 
                     authority further by bringing the tooth relic of the Buddha to Kandy from a place called Delgamuwa.In 1592 Kandy
                      became the capital city of the last remaining independent kingdom in the island after the coastal regions had been 
                      conquered by the Portuguese. Several invasions by the Portuguese were repelled, most notably in the campaign of
                       Danture. After the Sinhalese–Portuguese War and the establishment of Dutch Ceylon, attempts by the Dutch to conquer 
                       the kingdom were repelled.<br><br>On the north shore of the lake, which is enclosed by a parapet of white stone 
                       dating to the beginning of the 19th century, are the city's official religious monuments, including the Royal Palace
                        and the Temple of the Tooth, known as the Sri Dalada Maligawa (daḷadā māligāva). Reconstructed in the 18th century,
                         the Sri Dalada Maligawa is built on a base of granite that was inspired by the temples of Sri Lanka's former capital
                          city, Anuradhapura. An array of materials (limestone, marble, sculpted wood, ivory, etc.) contribute to the richness 
                          of this temple. Throughout this small holy city, a number of recent Buddhist monasteries can be found.</p>

               <div class="line"></div> 
              <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 14pt;">Kandy Lake, also known as Kiri Muhuda or the Sea of Milk, is an artificial lake in the heart of the hill city of Kandy, Sri Lanka, built in 1807 by King Sri Wickrama Rajasinghe next to the Temple of the Tooth. Over the years, it was reduced in size. It is a protected lake, with fishing banned. There are many legends and folklore regarding the lake. One such is that the small island at its center was used by the king’s helm for bathing and was connected to the palace by secret tunnel.<br><br>

                The lake in front of the Temple of the Tooth was formerly a stretch of paddy fields known as Tigolwela. It was converted to a lake by King Sri Wickrama Rajasinha in 1807. As there had been a pond named Kiri-muhuda (a "sea of milk") in the middle of the Tigolwela, the lake constructed subsequently too was named Kiri-muhuda. Deveda Moolacharya is considered the architect of the Kandy Lake. The king first built a dam across the paddy fields, starting from the Paththirippuwa (octagon) side, where the steps leading into the lake by the Mahamaluwa (Esplanade) are still visible, stretching across to the Poya-maluwa. The dam, upon which a roadway was constructed, allowed the king to go across to the Malwatte Vihare. According to D’Oyley, the dam was constructed between 1810–1812.<br><br>
                
                There are numerous local legends and folklore regarding the lake. One such is that the small island at its center was used by the king's harem for bathing and was connected to the palace by a secret tunnel.</p>

               <div class="line"></div> 
              <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 14pt;">Situated in Kandy’s suburb of Peradeniya, the spectacular Peradeniya Botanical Garden dates to 1371. Once enjoyed for pleasure by a Kandyan queen, this spectacular garden is enclosed on three sides by a large bend in the Mahaweli River. A Kandyan prince’s residence during the 18th Century, in the early 1800s the leafy green tangle became one of the greatest Botanical Gardens in the British Empire. For a short spell during the Second World War, it was used as the Allied Forces Headquarters for the Asian region.<br><br>

                The gardens display over 4 000 different species of plants, regarded amongst the most superior in Asia. The highlight is the spectacular Orchid collection and a mighty avenue of palm trees. In addition to a plethora of flowering plants, there is also an extensive collection of medicinal plants and spices which can be spotted on your meander across the gardens. Encompassing over 60 hectares of sublimely designed lawns, pavilions and plant houses, the extraordinary array of Sri Lankan, Asian and international flora is a fragrant, colourful view on the eye. Gorgeous avenues lead on to sections exploding in bursts of tropical colour and vast lawns dotted with enormous trees.<br><br>
                
                Reserved in advance, &BEYOND can organise buggy carts from the Gardens, and offers specialist botanical guides to accompany you during your garden visit. They will share their experiences and practical knowledge about flora and fauna hidden within the garden. A visit usually takes two to three hours.</p>

               <div class="line"></div> 
              <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 14pt;">Reaching the top of Ambuluwawa one can experience the most amazing 
                views which could sometimes be covered by 
                the ongoing mist. However, once the mist clears off the view can be scary and freak out climbers, especially 
                those who have a fear of heights. Do note that hiking Ambuluwawa is not at all dangerous or risky, but it would not be the 
                ideal kind of adventure for those with a fear of heights. Avoid leaning on the railing to capture photographs 
                especially at the top as this is extremely risky and one could easily slip off from here. Ambuluwawa is a 
                relatively easy hike to do which gives you 360 degree views of the surrounding mountains, forests, rivers and towns.<br><br>
                It is an area richly diverse, with evergreen forests, blossomed flower plants as well creepers and about 200 different kinds of plants from 80 plant families including a variety of medicinal plants. Ambuluwawa is surrounded by many mountains including Piduruthalagala from the East, Bible Rock (Bathalegala) from the West, Sri Pada (Adam’s Peak) from the South and Knuckles Mountain Range from the North. Apart from these mountains many other mountains are also clearly visible from here and adds to the beauty of the area. These are the Hanthana Mountain Range, Hunnasigiri Mountain and mountain ranges associated with Algalla and Kadugannawa. There is a cool mountain breeze in the area due to this reason.<br><br>
                The Ambuluwawa Hill and the adjacent forest is designated as a forest reservation which is named as the Ambuluwawa ICC Forest Reservation. The history of the Ambuluwawa Temple dates back to the 13th century during the reign of King Buwanekabahu IV. It is said that the Ambuluwawa Peak was the center of the Gampola Kingdom during his reign. But there is nothing with historical or archaeological values in here.</p>

Sembuwatta Lake is a man-made lake created from natural spring water. Alongside the lake is a natural swimming pool.

                Sembuwatta Lake is believed to be 9 m (30 ft) to 12 m (39 ft) deep. Currently the lake belongs to the Elkaduwa Plantations and produces electricity for the nearby villagers. Make Sembuwaththa Lake a centerpiece of your Matale vacation itinerary.</p>
